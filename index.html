      <div class="purpose"><p>What do you think of when you think of a Safe Space? Is it at home with your family? With your professor in a classroom or even with your friends in the dorms? No matter where you are you deserve access to a safe space. This fall semester, we are working on a group project that addresses how diversity on campus is currently being acknowledged for students. In hopes of providing students with greater access to safe spaces, we will create a website that offers all Scotties a space to express how they feel and be supported. Due to current circumstances, the website will be tailored to support students strictly virtually. We believe that a website geared towards safe space will make students feel valued and protected on the Agnes Scott Campus even if we are far apart.

  <p class="aboutus"> About Us: <br>
      SAFE SPACE is a group of open-minded individuals with a goal of keeping Scotties connected.
      Our aim is to grant Scotties the space to chat with other Scotties that share a common interest or issue that they would like to talk about. We want to provide a platform where Scotties feel comfortable and safe to talk about their problems that they are experiencing on campus.
