        PCOS affects around <strong>5 million </strong> young women in the <strong>US</strong> and <strong>1 in 15 women worldwide</strong> yet you donâ€™t hear about it often.
        PCOS is a condition which affects bodily hormone levels and thus causes the creation of ovarian cysts and the prevention of ovulation.
        Normally, during ovulation, the egg inside an ovarian follicle is expulsed and the leftover follice wrapper degenerates.
        An ovarian cyst is created when ovulation does not happen: the egg therefore stays trapped inside the follicle and the follice slowly grows in size.
        This may lead to an interruption in the monthly periodic cycle or an anovulatory cycle (no ovulation occurs).
        <br> <br>
        Both <strong>cause</strong> and <strong>cure</strong> of this syndrome are <strong>unknown</strong> and therefore women who suffer from PCOS need to closely monitor their mental, physical and nutritional health in order to avoid associated health risks.
        This website aims at raising awareness about PCOS, as well as providing young women with resources about how to care for themselves. Moreover, this platform prvoides a safe space to ask questions, share concerns and advice, as well as seeking help from a professional.
